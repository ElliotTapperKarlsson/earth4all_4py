**Python Implementation of the Earth4All Model**

earth4all_4py is an independent python implementation of the Earth4All model.

E4A is a world dynamics model that integrates mathematical modeling, system dynamics, and social sciences. Its primary goal is to provide insights into the trajectory of societal development and its ecological impacts. The Earth4All model allows for simulating the evolution of global societal development as well as ecological effects. The original model is implemented in VensimPLE (a system dynamics software), which is suitable for building models of this kind, however it lacks a large community of users. This Python implementation aims to produce several advantages to the original, such as broader accessibility, a larger user community, and the ability to scale and customize simulations in an open-source environment.
